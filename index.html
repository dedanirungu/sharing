How Shared economy can be to used to eradicate poverty

Most people living in poverty, live a life with lack of resources.This can be changed the lives of community members by improving access to resources. This can be done by having most needed resources shared within the community which will result in an increase in member earnings and better livelihood.

Questions


Is abject poverty related to earning below $2
Can lack of resource equal to no result
Can resources sharing make resource available 
Can communities have share strategy against poverty


I will focus and reference my analysis on the Gathima self Help group.

The group was started in 2002 with an aim of  assisting members during funerals and weddings. Group members noticed that they usually incur high cost of hiring items when hosting events and they therefore decided to form a group with a main purpose of buying the frequently hired items. The group shared items can be borrowed by any member hosting an event and return once they are through with the event.

Some of the items that the group has include; tents, chairs, generators, Public Address systems, large cooking pots, cooking stoves etc. They also have  human skills such as venue setup personnel, cooks, and system maintenance personnel.

The group follows a model of Table organisation with elected chairman, secretary, treasurer and over 200 members.

Through my interaction with the group I have noticed a pattern in earning and employment which can affect member contribution to the group especially for those members who earn below $2. Most of the employment opportunities are within the community and therefore it is easier to establish a pattern.

Also idea of sharing resources has enabled members to have access to same resources equally and at no cost 

Table organisation
Table organisation is a group of people that are brought together by the same need and the group members work together for the purpose of meeting the need. Some group purposes can be financial, resources, skill based and time sharing.

Table organisations can be of different forms which include verbal agreement, written constitution, registered group and sacco.

Table organisation usually has formal structure with elected chairman, secretary, treasurer and members.

Some group purposes can be financial, resources, skill based and time sharing.

Financial: the group will work together to offer easy access to credit.
Resources: the group will work together to acquire shared resource or assist members in purchasing resources
Skill based: group will work together to share complementary skills that enables them to work on a project as one team. Eg mason and electrician 
Time sharing: the group will work together to reduce labour cost by volunteering to each other activities.


Illustration on Resources
Let assume that the group was  started with the purpose of assisting members acquire resources. Such as  water tanks, cooking stoves, TV and more.

Let's assume we have a 10 member group which would like to buy a water tank for each member  that is sold at $50 each and a monthly contribution per member is $10.

The Group contribution per month will be a total of $100 which is only enough for 2 tanks. The group will then take a vote to establish which of its 2 members will benefit and  take the tanks on every month until everyone has a tank. At the end of 5 month the group will select another resource and repeat the process.

There are those groups which have established shared resources. The group can share resources by level of priority or first come First served. 
Eg In Githima funeral events supersedes all other events followed by weddings. Therefore resources sharing is assigned in order of  priority.

Earning Structure
To understand the group members' earning structure, I would like to define a range that can be used to group members' income. People earning similar amounts usually have similar success, challenges and needs. 

World bank Format of grouping earning is based on sequential multiplier  that start at 1 to 8 and it work as follows;

Minimum amount needed per day is $2.

1 x $2  =  $2     x    30  = $60
2 x $2  =  $4     x    30  = $120
3 x $2  =  $6     x    30  = $180
4 x $2  =  $8     x    30  = $240
5 x $2  =  $10   x    30  = $300
6 x $2  =  $12   x    30  = $360
7 x $2  =  $14   x    30  = $420
8 x $2  =  $16   x    30  = $480

For easy understanding I will name then as follows
0 - 60               ->    zone 0
60 - 120           ->    zone 60
120 - 180         ->    zone 120
180 - 240         ->    zone 180
240 - 300         ->    zone 240
300 - 360         ->    zone 300
360 - 420         ->    zone 360
420 - 480         ->    zone 480
Above 480       ->    Above 480On credit access, creditworthiness is based on documented income. The loan's monthly repayment amount is usually below 30% of documented monthly income. Most creditors prefer offering loans above $700 with minimum repayment period of 1 year .

If the above data is  arranged in a horizontal chart for third world countries and mostly Africa, you will get a pyramid chart.

Here are some charts for different countries.

Many people earning between 0 - 60  and 60 - 120  their income is usually undocumented which makes it harder for them to access any form of credit. This can make them lack key resources of production and hence remain stuck in poverty. Getting stuck in poverty becomes a race to meet the needs of shelter, food, clothing, water, diseases, education etc.

The race is so much that any money made can not last one night therefore they live with no savings. If an emergency happens like sickness, the house head is forced to borrow first before thinking about taking the sick to hospital.

Their life can be well explained on gapminder.com street dollar.

In my observation, most people start to employ part time laborers once they start earning 180 - 240 which might be related to the middle class in Kenya that start at $230.

Associating with groups can help members get access to credit through proof of documentation by members' contributions and also individuals can have easy access to shared resources.

Shared Economy

According to Robert Hacker Ted Talk video “The poor know how to overcome poverty”, for the community to progress it  needs  to use a 4 part framework which are Network, Technology (Resource), Information and Government.

Network: when people come together they are able to inditentfly each others needs therefore they can meet the needs via commerce
Technology: It offer new way of doing things
Information: Offer a way on how to perform a task
Government: Offer the lead and guideline for the society.

The focus will be Technology and Information. The discussion will not focus on  Network and Government because the Githima group exists as a network and government has allowed the group to operate.

The major challenge is mostly on Resource for performing any form of production. 

Eg a chef who is good at preparing pizza will fail to prepare one if he lacks an oven for baking it. This will be also the case for a farmer who lacks a chaff cutter for preparing animal feed. The farmer will have low milk production and might even lose the animal during the dry season.

Therefore: 
Information    +   Resource    =    Result.

This means If you lack one you will not have any results.

Some of the resources that a group would like to have are;

Chaff cutter
Interlocking brick making machine
Water pump
Battery powered Welding set
Maize cob remover
Small Tractors
Small hay baler etc

People in a group are also able to share skills and knowledge which increase the group knowhow  and they in addition offer free labor or shared labour that can eleminite labour cost between members.

For illustration with a chaff cutter.

If one chaff cutter can be shared from farm to farm, each farmer can be able to prepare animal feed that can last for months. This will enable the farmer to get more milk production from a low of 3kg with improper feeding to 9kg with good feeding practices. If the milk is sold at the current market rate of 30 cents dollars, there will be an increase in earning from $27 to $81 when keeping 1 cow (which is above the poverty line) and $81 to $243 when keeping 3 cows the current average (which is above lower middle class).

For illustration with Interlocking Brick Making Machine

The most popular house construction method in Kenya is by mud and clay. During the material preparation 15-25 young trees are cut down and another 10 are pruned to meet the house frame needs.

The house that is constructed has a lifespan of 7-10 years and in places with termite the lifespan can be even shorter. Once damaged beyond repair, another house is built that will end up taking the same number of resources. Some of the challenges of said house can be;
ecological destructive cycle that repeats every 10 years. 
Easy access to insects, rodents, and snakes including jiggers 
Poor hygiene especial once the house start to decay
Respiratory disease due to dust

By group sharing an interlocking brick making machine and  switching to the building house made of bricks, they can overcome all challenges of mud and clay houses. The machine can also be used to construct other farm structures like stores, animal shades, pavement etc


Purchasing all this resources can be a challenge to most members because;
They are expensive
Some used once per season.
Some need high skills to operate

Therefore resources sharing can offer access to resources without owning them.

Open Source Ecology
Open source ecology is an idea by Marcin Jakubowski wher farm and industrial machine design sets are open source and any person can fabricate either the whole machine or parts of the machine without infringing on any copyright.

This can be a major advantage in case of isolated communities that live in arid areas, deserts, islands or in forest(eg Congo forest). For those isolated communities Moving these sets of machines for repair outside this zone can be a challenge. By using Open Source ecology those communities can develop their own repair sets and methods and where possible communities can establish their own production shop for basic machines.




Conclusion
By redefining earnings structure based on the world bank we are able to see different structure patterns and how employment is set.
By Enabling table organisations to have shared resource it can improve life of the members
By using open source ecology ideas, communities will be able to produce their own set of machines or manage their own repair works.
